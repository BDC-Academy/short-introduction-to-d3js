    <h2>SVG only chart</h2>
    <!-- We start by defining an inline svg container element.
    -  add an svg element inside the div#root
    -  set a 'version' 1.1 and a xml namespace 'xmlns' attribute on the svg element. 
    -  set a width and height to make it a square of 400 by 400 (pixels)
    -  set a class 'my-graphic'. The style.css is used to make the svg a block element and center in on screen with display: block; margin: 0 auto;

    TIP: it is a good idea to see what you have created in the browser after every step and use inspect element to examine the DOM.
    Note: version and namespace attributes are optional when using a 'inline' SVG like we are doing now.
    Note2: if you don't supply a width and height to the SVG container, a default of 300 x 150 (pixels) will be used in all browsers. 
    Note3: Note: In the most basic case one pixel in an SVG document maps to one pixel on the output device (a.k.a. the screen). One user unit equals one screen unit.

    <svg id="svg-chart" class="my-graphic" version="1.1" width="400" height="400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    
      <!-- TODO: 1. creating elements and defining their width and height
        A rect element can be used to draw, you guessed it, rectangles.
          - create a rect element with a 'width' attribute of 40 and a 'height' attribute of 300 (pixels)
          - give the rect a color #294899 using the 'fill' attribute
      -->

      <!-- TODO: 2. positioning different elements on the grid
        Positioning basically works by providing x and y coordinates that the element should start and sometimes end at.
        x determines the position left to right where 0 is to the far left, and y determines the position from top to bottom where 0 is the absolute top.
        Where the drawing of an element begins however, depends on the 'basic shape' you are using (rect, circle, line, etc.)
        
        Rects are drawn from the top left, so to calculate where the bottom right will be,
        you need to add the x and y position to the width and height. 
        For example, if you have a rect width 100 and height 200 and x=20 and y=40, 
        the top left will be at position x 20 and y 40 and the bottom right will be at x 20 + 100 and y 40 + 200
          - calculate the x and y to position the rect exactly in the middle of svg
          - position the rect almost at the bottom (50px above) and exactly in the center of the svg with the x and y attributes
          - add four more rects width the same width and a different height and position 2 to the left and 2 to the right of the existing one. Put 5 pixels between each rect
          - are your bars hanging from the ceiling by any change? Remember y position 0 is at the top of the svg an the rect is drawn from the top left.
      -->

      <!-- TODO: 3. adding a line element
        You should have five vertical bars next to eachother by now, lets add a line element to it.
        The line element draws a straight line from point a to point b. The starting point a has an x and y position as does the ending point b.
          - create a line element and define its starting point a with x1 and y1. Set the starting point exactly at the bottom left of your left most rectangle
          - define point b where the line should end with x2 and y2. Set the end of the line exactly at the bottom right of your right most rectangle
          - inspect the DOM and wonder why your line is not showing :)
       -->

      <!-- TODO: 4. adding borders to our elements
         Elements can be surrounded by borders like in html, with the 'stroke' attribute.
         Stroke is more useful than just for adding a border, it is actually needed to draw lines and paths.
         As we just saw, the line itself is not visible as it has no 'height' and no attribute for it. We need to add a stroke to it, to make it show up.
          - add a 'stroke' attribute to the line element. The 'stroke' determines the color, use red as value
          - add a 'stroke-width' attribute to the line element with which you can determine the size of the line (default 1). set it to 2.
          - are your bars now standing on top of the line? They should be, so fix it if they are not ;)
          - create another line, this time make it vertical, 300px long and and position it exactly to the left of our first rectangle
          - the lines should be sort of 'connecting', if they our not fix it
          - imagine our red lines being an horizontal (x) and a vertical (y) axis
            To make it look a little bit more appealing, add 20 pixels to the the left and right of the x axis (20 px is half a bar) and
            connect the vertical line to the horizontal again.

        Of course, we can also give our rectangle a border with the stroke attribute. 
        Remember, a stroke will be drawn AROUND a shape. Find out what that means for the rect:
          - Add a 'border' to the middle rect with the 'stroke' and 'stroke-width' attributes. use the color green and stroke-width 5 (pixels)
          - Compare the size of the rects, what changed?
          - remove the border again. Instead, to the bar stand out because it is important, give it the color green
         -->

      <!-- TODO: 5. adding text to the equation 
        Text element can also be positioned with the x and y attributes, colored with the 'fill' attribute and can even have a border with the 'stroke' attribute.
        You can further manipulate the appearance of the text with attributes similar to those of HTML/CSS,
        like font-size, font-weight, font-weight and font-family.
        Positioning the text with x and y determines the STARTING point (top left) of the text.
        Positioning the text element in the center of the svg will not display the text exactly in the middle, because the x and y position are used as STARTING point. 
        The text can be aligned however, by setting the 'text-anchor' attribute to start, middle or end with a default of start.
        text-anchor alignes the text horizontal and the 'dominant-baseline' attribute alignes it vertical with auto, middle and hanging as its most used values.
          - create a text element with the text 'ma'. The actual text is defined as a child of the text element.
          - use the 'fill', 'font-weight' and 'font-size' attributes to give the text a color, make it bold and size 14
          - position the text (x and y) with the same y value as the horizontal line and the same x value as the first column
          - the text should now be 'standing' on top op of the horizontal line and at the bottom left of the first bar. Use the 'dominant-baseline' attribute to align the text so it is 'hanging' beneath the line
          - create a text element for each bar di, wo, do, vr and position them beneath the right bar
        -->

      <!-- TODO: 6. use a group to move all our text elements 
        Our text elements are NOT perfectly centered beneath our columns (if you did it right ;)).
        We could manipulate every element separately to make them position perfectly, but it is way nicer if we could do it all at once.
        Well, we can! With the svg group element g. A group element does not represent a visual entity in svg but only groups other elements.
        You can't give a group element a height, width, x or y but you can use other attributes that are then inherited by its child element.
        Even though you can't position a g element, you can 'transform' the whole group just like in CSS.
        - add a g element and move the text elements inside it so they become child elements
        - add a 'transform' attribute to the g element with the value 'translate(20, 0)'. This will push the whole group 20px to the right
        - now all text elements START exactly in the middle of each bar, but to actually center them beneath the bars we need to set text-anchor to middle on each of them
          luckily, we can just do this by setting it on the group element and all the text elements will inherit this property. So set the attribute text-anchor to middle on the g element.
        - you can move all the properties that are the same for each text element to the group element. Come on! Do it!! Do it now!!!
      -->

      <!-- TODO: 7. now add the vertical y axis
        We're almost done with our static svg column chart but we still need values on our y-axis.
        It should have eleven text elements starting with 0 at the exact bottom of the vertical line and 100 at the exact top.
        The text elements should be positioned slightly to the left of the vertical line
        and evenly distributed along the length of the line. See if you can manage all this without me telling you the steps to take ;)  
      -->

      <!-- TODO Extra: group all the things! 
        Now that you saw the power and use of the svg group element, do you see more elements that could be in a group?
        Note: groups can also be nested inside groups, inside groups, inside groups... inception
        Note2: using transform translate can also make calculating x and y values easier, for example when drawing the rects/columns
      -->

      <!-- TODO Extra: add 'value tooltips' and display the bar values as a text element
        It's hard to read what value each column is. Let's add some text elements that display the exact value of each bar.
        Place each bar value 'inside' (on top of) the bars and color them white for readability.
       -->

      <!-- TODO Extra: add gridlines to make it even more clear
        You can also add horizontal lines, usually dotted, that originate at each value / tick on the y-axis to make the bars more readable.
        Usually gridlines or exact values are used in a column chart, sometimes both. 
        It depends on what insight is most important, the exact value or the relative size of each bar. 
        Well, what are you waiting for. Go create some gridlines.
